# Bug Report: BLIX-002

## Summary

**Title:** Cookie Settings - Multiple toggle buttons unresponsive to user interaction across settings interface  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Priority:** P2

## Environment

- **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (SM-G990B2/DS)
- **OS:** Android 13 (One UI 5.1)
- **App Version:** Blix Test APK
- **Network State:** WiFi
- **Session Reference:** Test session timestamps 04:40-10:00

## Reproduction

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Install and launch the Blix application
2. Tap "Dostosuj" on the initial privacy consent dialog
3. Navigate to any of the following sections:
   - "Analizy i statystyki" > "Dostawcy" > Google Analytics toggle
   - "Zapewnienie bezpieczeństwa, zapobieganie oszustwom i naprawianie błędów" toggle
   - "Dostarczanie i prezentowanie reklam i treści" toggle
   - "Zapisanie decyzji dotyczących prywatności oraz informowanie o nich" toggle
   - Any "Dostawcy" group toggle button
4. Attempt to toggle the switch for each setting (try multiple taps)
5. Observe that toggle states remain unchanged despite user interaction

### Expected Behavior

All toggle buttons should respond to user interaction, changing state between enabled and disabled when tapped, allowing users to control their privacy preferences.

### Actual Behavior

Multiple toggle buttons throughout the cookie settings interface remain unresponsive when tapped, preventing users from changing their consent preferences for various data processing purposes and vendors.

## Evidence & Analysis

### Technical Impact Assessment

1. **User Control Issue:** Prevents users from exercising their right to control data collection
2. **Potential Compliance Issue:** Violates GDPR requirements for effective consent management
3. **User Experience Impact:** Creates significant frustration when privacy settings cannot be modified
4. **Pattern Issue:** The widespread nature of the problem suggests a systemic implementation error
5. **Legal Risk:** May violate ePrivacy regulations requiring functional consent mechanisms

### Affected Areas

The issue affects toggles in multiple sections:

- Google Analytics provider toggle [04:40]
- "Zapewnienie bezpieczeństwa..." toggle [08:12]
- "Dostarczanie i prezentowanie reklam..." toggle [09:10]
- "Zapisanie decyzji dotyczących prywatności..." toggle [10:00]
- Multiple "Dostawcy" group toggles throughout the interface

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue likely stems from:

- Event listeners not properly attached to toggle UI components
- Event propagation issues in the consent management framework
- Touch target area configuration problems making interaction zones too small
- State management conflict between parent and child toggle components
- Race condition between UI rendering and event handler initialization

## Recommended Resolution

1. Implement proper event handling for all toggle buttons in the consent management interface
2. Ensure toggle states are correctly synchronized with the underlying consent storage
3. Verify that the CMP implementation correctly processes and stores user consent choices
4. Conduct comprehensive regression testing across all toggle components
5. Consider implementing visual feedback (e.g., ripple effect) to indicate touch registration

## Additional Notes

The pervasive nature of this issue across the consent management interface suggests a fundamental implementation flaw rather than isolated bugs. This represents a significant compliance risk since privacy regulations require effective mechanisms for users to control their consent preferences.
