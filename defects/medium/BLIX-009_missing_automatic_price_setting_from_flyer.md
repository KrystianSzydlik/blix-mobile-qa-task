## Reproduction

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Search for any product (e.g., milk)
2. Select a variant from a specific store with a price from the flyer
3. Add the product to the shopping list
4. Check if the product price in the shopping list matches the price visible in the flyer

### Technical Impact Assessment

1. **Usability Issue:** The need to manually enter prices reduces application usage efficiency
2. **UX Inconsistency:** Users would expect automatic transfer of price information
3. **Core Functionality Gap:** Does not fully utilize the potential of integration between promotional flyers and shopping lists

## Recommended Resolution

1. Implement automatic price transfer from flyers to shopping lists
2. Add option to modify price after automatic setting
3. Display information about price source (e.g., "Price from Å»abka flyer")
4. Test accuracy of price extraction from various flyer formats
