## Scenarios Tested

### 1. SHOPPING LIST MANAGEMENT

**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed

#### Areas Covered

- List creation with various naming patterns
- List editing and renaming
- Icon selection and customization

> - Application allows duplicate list names without warning
> - Application truncates long list names with no method to view full name except in edit mode
> - List renaming functionality consistently fails across both default and user-created lists
> - Name suggestion logic is inconsistent between creating and editing lists
> - Icon selection and saving functions properly
> - List deletion shows inconsistent navigation behavior, sometimes redirecting to flyers, other times to home screen
>
> **Defects Found:** [BLIX-003](../../defects/medium/BLIX-003_shopping_list_issues.md), [BLIX-004](../../defects/medium/BLIX-004_shopping_list_validation_and_display_issues.md), [BLIX-005](../../defects/medium/BLIX-005_shopping_list_name_suggestion_logic_problems.md), [BLIX-010](../../defects/medium/BLIX-010_incorrect_navigation_after_shopping_list_deletion.md)

- Conduct network traffic analysis using Charles Proxy (planned for Charter3)
- Investigate app behavior with very large shopping lists (performance testing)
- Test multi-user collaboration features more extensively
- Verify notification handling and push message processing

## Device Performance Notes

- Device remained responsive throughout testing
- No excessive battery drain observed during testing session
